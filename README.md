## General
Pythostitcher is a Python implementation of the [AutoStitcher](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep29906) software which stitches prostate histopathology images into an artifical whole mount image. Although the general stitching mechanism of Pythostitcher is similar to AutoStitcher, PythoStitcher is implemented in Python and significantly faster compared to the [original implementation in Matlab](https://engineering.case.edu/centers/ccipd/content/software). In addition, Pythostitcher offers several new advanced features such as 1) automatically finding the optimal fragment configuration, 2) saving the end result at maximum resolution (0.25 µm pixel spacing), 3) providing a smooth overlap between overlapping parts with gradient alpha blending and 4) providing support for a varying number of tissue fragments. 

## Algorithm input
The input for Pythostitcher consists of either two or four high resolution histopathology images and the corresponding tissue masks. These tissue masks can be generated by your tissue segmentation algorithm of choice, in the provided sample data we make use of the algorithm from [Bándi et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31871843/). Although not required, the user may specify the desired location of the tissue fragments in the final reconstruction. In the case of a prostatectomy cross-section which consists of four fragments, these locations would be upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right. Currently, supported locations are ['upper left', 'upper right', 'lower left', 'lower right', 'right', 'left', 'top', 'bottom']. If these locations are not specified, PythoStitcher will automatically figure out the most suitable way to reconstruct the whole-mount. 

## Algorithm details
After preprocessing the input images, Pythostitcher will perform an automated stitch edge detection and compute a rough initial alignment on heavily downsampled versions of the input images. This initial alignment is then iteratively refined using images with an increasingly finer resolution. This refinement is performed by a genetic algorithm, which aims to minimize the average distance between the stitch edges of adjacent fragments. One of the strengths of Pythostitcher is that the optimal alignment between fragments can be scaled linearly for finer resolutions. Hence, when a satisfactory alignment is achieved on a lower resolution, this alignment can be scaled up linearly to compute the full resolution stitched result. 

## Usage instructions
It is highly recommended to run PythoStitcher as a Docker container, since PythoStitcher uses [PyVips](https://github.com/libvips/pyvips) and the backend from [ASAP](https://github.com/computationalpathologygroup/ASAP), which both can not be readily pip installed. The Docker container comes prepackaged with these libraries and should run out-of-the-box. 

You can try out Pythostitcher yourself on the sample data available from <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7002505"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7002505.svg" alt="DOI"></a>. This sample data includes two prostatectomy cases with four fragments and one oesophagectomy case with two fragments. After downloading the data, place each case in the respective 'tissue directory' and ensure that the data is now structured as follows. If you want to enforce the location of each fragment in the final reconstruction, be sure to include a force_configuration.txt file in each patient directory. See the example_force_configuration.txt file on how to format this.

After preparing the input data in the aforementioned format, you can run PythoStitcher through the command line using:

    python3 main.py --data_dir {/path/to/sample_data/} --save_dir {/your/custom/path/} --patient {patient_idx} 
where *data_dir* refers to the directory with your input data, *save_dir* refers to the location to save the result and *patient* refers to one of the cases in the data directory. Example line to obtain the result for patient P000001 from the prostate dataset:

    python3 main.py --data_dir "~/pythostitcher/sample_data" --save_dir "~/pythostitcher/results" --patient "P000001"
