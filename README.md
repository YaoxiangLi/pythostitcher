# PythoStitcher

PythoStitcher is a Python implementation of the AutoStitcher software which stitches prostate histopathology images into a pseudo whole mount image. For more information about AutoStitcher, check out the original paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep29906) or find the original Matlab implementation [here](https://engineering.case.edu/centers/ccipd/content/software).

You can try out Pythostitcher yourself by running the main script on the provided sample data. Read the docstring in the main.py file for further instructions. Attached below is the approximate result you should get for the sample data. Note that your result may differ slightly due to the randomly generated mutations in every generation of the genetic algorithm.
